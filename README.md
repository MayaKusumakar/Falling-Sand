# Falling-Sand

Realistic simulator of certain entities in the world and some fantatical entities, and their reaction with other entities. Entities include: metal, sand, water, fish, acid, lava, shrinkers, obsideon, gas, fungi, fungi ghosts, and transporters. To use these entities, click on the button with the according name, then draw on the black screen on the left of the buttons.

Metal:
Metal is a grey substance that stays where it was built. 

- Water will move on it, however, if the metal is flat or horizontal, eventually the water would fall off the flat piece of metal, similarly to normal water.
- Fish: no reaction
- Acid: If acid comes into contact with sand, it will destroy the piece of sand it came into contact with.
- Lava: Lava will sit on the metal, but act the same as water in regards to staying on the piece of metal
- Shrink: Shrink will get rid of a fraction of the total amount of metal that is present in the world.
- Obsidean: no reaction
- Gas: no reaction
- Fungi: Fungi will eat and take over the place of the sand pixel it came in contact with
- Fungi Ghosts: no reaction
- Transport: Whatever pixel it comes in contact with, it will randomly teleport that pixel anywhere in the world

Sand:
Sand is a yellow substance that will fall to the bottom of the world, and stack on top of itself.

- Metal: no reaction
- Water: Water will sit in the holes the sand provides and move around in its little hole.
- Fish: no reaction
- Acid: If acid comes into contact with sand, it will destroy the piece of sand it came into contact with.
- Lava: Lava will act similar to water, and will just stay in the holes that the sand naturally provides.
- Shrink: Shrink will get rid of a fraction of the total amount of sand that is present in the world.
- Obsidean: no reaction
- Gas: no reaction
- Fungi: Fungi will eat and take over the place of the sand pixel it came in contact with
- Fungi Ghosts: no reaction
- Transport: Whatever pixel it comes in contact with, it will randomly teleport that pixel anywhere in the world

Water:
Water is a blue substance that moves around to the left, right, and down. Water reacts differently with different elements. 

- Metal: Water will move on the metal, however, if the metal is flat or horizontal, eventually the water would fall off the flat piece of metal, similarly to normal water.
- Sand: Water will sit in the holes the sand provides and move around in its little hole.
- Fish: Fish pixles will move around in the confines that the water provides, if the water dissapears, the fish dies.
- Acid: If acid comes into contact with water, it will destroy the piece of water it came into contact with.
- Lava: If lava comes into contact with water, the point of contact will become obsideon.
- Shrink: Shrink will get rid of a fraction of the total amount of water that is present in the world.
- Obsidean: no reaction
- Gas: no reaction
- Fungi: Fungi will eat and take over the place of the water pixel it came in contact with
- Fungi Ghosts: no reaction
- Transport: Whatever pixel it comes in contact with, it will randomly teleport that pixel anywhere in the world

Fish:
Fish is a pink substance that moves around in water randomly. If the water dissapears, the fish dies and dissapears.

- Metal: no reaction
- Sand: no reaction
- Water: Fish only exists in water, and will move around in it randomly
- Acid: If acid comes into contact with fish, it will destroy the fish it came into contact with.
- Lava: lava will kill the fish it comes into contact with and make it dissapear
- Shrink: Shrink will get rid of a fraction of the total amount of fish that is present in the world.
- Obsidean: no reaction
- Gas: no reaction
- Fungi: Fungi will eat and take over the place of the fish pixel it came in contact with
- Fungi Ghosts: no reaction
- Transport: Whatever pixel it comes in contact with, it will randomly teleport that pixel anywhere in the world

Acid: 
Acid is a green substance that travels to the left, down, and right randomly, and will destroy whatever it comes into contact with, however, it also destroys itself.

- Metal: If it comes into contact with it, it will destroy it
- Sand: If it comes into contact with it, it will destroy it
- Water: If it comes into contact with it, it will destroy it
- Fish: If it comes into contact with it, it will destroy it
- Lava: If it comes into contact with it, it will destroy it
- Shrink: Shrink will get rid of a fraction of the total amount of fish that is present in the world.
- Obsidean: If it comes into contact with it, it will destroy it
- Gas: If it comes into contact with it, it will destroy it
- Fungi: Fungi will eat and take over the place of the acid pixel it came in contact with
- Fungi Ghosts: no reaction
- Transport: Whatever pixel it comes in contact with, it will randomly teleport that pixel anywhere in the world

Lava:
Lava is a red substance that acts exactly like water, except it kills fish instead of harboring it, and if it comes into contact with water, it will create obsideon at the point of contact.

Shrink:
Shrink rapidly moves in all directions, looking for something to come into contact with, when it comes into contact with something, it destroys a fraction of the pixels of the type that the shrink just came minto contact with.

ie: if a shrink comes into contact with water, the shrink particle will dissapear and a fraction of all the water in the world will disapear. 

Obsideon: 
Acts the same as metal, only difference is it is created when water and lava come into contact with each other.

Gas:
gas travels to the top of the world and will move around frantically at the top

- Metal: If metal blocks its way, gas will find a way to get to the top of the screen, the metal will just hinder the process
- Sand: no reaction
- Water: no reaction
- Fish: no reaction
- Acid: If acid comes into contact with gas, it will destroy the pixel it came into contact with.
- Lava: no reaction
- Shrink: Shrink will get rid of a fraction of the total amount of gas that is present in the world.
- Obsidean: no reaction
- Fungi: Fungi will eat and take over the place of the gas pixel it came in contact with
- Fungi Ghosts: no reaction
- Transport: Whatever gas pixel it came into contact with, it will randomly teleport that pixel anywhere in the world

Fungi:
Fungi is a green substance that grows exponentially, it will grow off of itself, and take over the spot that ANY other substance has occupied. The only way to get rid of fungi is to eradicate EVERY pixel of fungi, and then it will fail to grow. The only thing that can get rid of fungi, are the fungi ghosts.

Fungi Ghosts:
Fungi Ghosts, much like fish, can only exist in fungi, hoever, disimilarly to fish, fungi ghosts destroy the fungi that it comes into contact with. Fungi ghosts rapidly travel through the fungi trying to get rid of it all. 

Transport:
Transport randomly goes in all directions, trying to find something to come into contact with, when it comes into contact with something, it randomly transports that pixel to a random place in the world.

Goodbye World:
Just empties the world of everything, and makes it black again.
